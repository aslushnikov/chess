In 2011 I was suggested to write a chess game with AI, from scratch and in two days.
The AI had to be strong enough to overcome an average player. In case
of success, a reward of $1000 was promised.

I managed to fit in the deadlines and got the reward.

Today, the money are long gone, but I'm still very proud that the AI won over
a lot of my friends. You can try it yourself [here](https://aslushnikov.github.io/chess/).
