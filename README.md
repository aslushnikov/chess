In 2011 I was suggested to write a chess game with AI.

The AI had to be strong enough to overcome an average player,
and I was given two days to complete the project. In case
of success, the company promissed to pay 1000$.

In two days, I ended up with a working solution and got 1000$.

The money are long gone, but I'm still very proud that the AI won over
a lot of my friends. You can try it yourself [here](https://aslushnikov.github.io/chess/).

Note that the AI is a little slow. The yellow bulb in the top-right corner
means it's thinking. As far as I remember, the game engine implements
all of the chess rules.
